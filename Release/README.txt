Original By Phillipp the Cat
AutoHotkey By Gaztin

Instructions:
1) Open the run.bat file with a text editor (Notepad works)
2) Change the directory to the location of your witcher3.exe. This works because the game comes without DRM! Thanks CD PROJEKT RED!
3) Open the TW3 Speedrun Launcher, and change the 4 SET commands to the location of the program asked.
4) Run the TW3 Speedrun Launcher whenever you want to play the game.

If there are any errors, the TW3 Speedrun Launcher will give you some troubleshooting tips, or else feel free to contact either nicnacnic or Phillipp the Cat on Discord.

Have fun running!
